Bio-Community
==========================


ABOUT

The Bio-Community distribution contains a set of generic, open, object-oriented,
cross-platform Perl modules to represent and manipulate communities of
biological organisms. Bio-Community is part of the BioPerl project
(http://bioperl.org/).


INSTALLATION & DEPENDENCIES

Bio-Community requires Perl 5.10 or above. Additionally, these Perl modules are
required and will be installed during the installation procedure:

  BioPerl version >= 1.6.923
  DateTime
  Getopt::Euclid
  JSON::XS
  Hash::Util
  Math::Random::MT
  Method::Signatures
  Module::Runtime
  Moose
  Moose::Util::TypeConstraints
  MooseX::NonMoose
  MooseX::StrictConstructor
  PerlIO:eol
  Scalar::Util
  Tie::IxHash
  Test::Number::Delta

This other module is recommended:
  Math::GSL::SF

The easiest way to install Bio-Community is using the CPAN way. See the detailed
instructions at http://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html

To install the Bio-Community modules by hand, type the following in a terminal:
   perl Build.PL
   ./Build installdeps   (as administrator)
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install       (as administrator)


OVERVIEW

The ./lib/ folder contains the Bio-Community modules, which provide various
objects and operations:

 * The main objects are the community, member and metacommunity, provided by
   Bio::Community, Bio::Community::Member and Bio::Community::Meta, respectively

 * Reading and writing files in various formats, e.g. QIIME, biom, is possible
   through Bio::Community::IO

 * Alpha, beta and gamma diversity metrics are implemented in the modules
   Bio::Community::Alpha, Bio::Community::Meta::Beta and Bio::Community::Meta::Gamma

 * Bio::Community::Tools::* are modules providing various operations like random
   sampling, rarefaction or taxonomic summaries.

The ./scripts/ folder contains scripts. All these scripts use the Bio::Community
modules and are useful for reading or writing files, rarefying, 
They are good examples of how Bio::Community modules can be used as building
blocks for more complex programs. For convenience, all scripts are prefixed with
'bc_'.

The ./t/ folder contains unit tests to ensure the proper functioning of the
Bio-Community mocules. The ./t/data/ further contains data files used for the
tests and is thus a good source of example data.
