Bio-Community version 0.01
==========================


ABOUT BIO-COMMUNITY

The Bio-Community distribution contains a set of generic, open, object-oriented,
cross-platform Perl modules to represent and manipulate communities of
biological organisms. Bio-Community is part of the BioPerl project
(http://bioperl.org/).


INSTALLATION & DEPENDENCIES

The Bio-Community modules require Perl 5.10 or above. Additionally, these Perl
modules are required and will be installed during the installation procedure:

  BioPerl version > 1.6.910
  Bio-Root 1.7 (bundled here)
  DateTime
  Getopt::Euclid
  JSON::XS
  Hash::Util
  Math::Random::MT
  Method::Signatures
  Moose
  Moose::Util::TypeConstraints
  MooseX::NonMoose
  MooseX::StrictConstructor
  Parallel::Iterator
  PerlIO:eol
  Scalar::Util
  Tie::IxHash
  Test::Number::Delta

This other module is recommended:
  Math::BigInt::GMP

To install the Bio::Community modules, type the following:
   perl Build.PL
   ./Build installdeps   (as administrator)
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install       (as administrator)


MODULE OVERVIEW

The ./lib/ folder contains the Bio-Community modules, which provide various
objects and operations:

 * The main objects are the community, member and metacommunity, provided by
   Bio::Community, Bio::Community::Member and Bio::Community::Meta, respectively

 * Reading and writing files in various formats, e.g. QIIME, biom, is possible
   through Bio::Community::IO

 * Alpha, beta and gamma diversity metrics are implemented in the modules
   Bio::Community::Alpha, Bio::Community::Meta::Beta and Bio::Community::Meta::Gamma

 * Bio::Community::Tools::* are modules providing various operations like random
   sampling, rarefaction or taxonomic summaries.

The ./scripts/ folder contains scripts. All these scripts use the Bio::Community
modules and are useful for reading or writing files, rarefying, 
They are good examples of how Bio::Community moudles can be used as building
blocks for more complex programs.

The ./t/ folder contains unit tests to ensure the proper functioning of the
Bio-Community mocules. The ./t/data/ further contains data files used for the
tests and is thus a good source of example data.

modules. Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list,
