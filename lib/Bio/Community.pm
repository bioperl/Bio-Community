=head1 NAME

Bio::Community - A biological community

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Bio::Community;
  
  my $community = Bio::Community->new( -name => 'soil_1' );
  $community->add_member( $member1 );    # add 1 such Bio::Community::Member
  $community->add_member( $member2, 3 ); # add 3 such members

  print "There are ".$community->get_members_count." members in the community\n";
  print "The total diversity is ".$community->get_richness." species\n";

  while (my $member = $community->next_member) {
     my $member_id     = $member->id;
     my $member_count  = $community->get_count($member);
     my $member_rel_ab = $community->get_rel_ab($member);
     print "The relative abundance of member $member_id is $member_rel_ab % ($member_count counts)\n";
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Bio::Community module represents communities of biological organisms. It is
composed of Bio::Community::Member objects at a specified abundance. Each member
can represent a species (e.g. an elephant, a bacterium), taxon, OTU, or any
proxy for a species.

=head1 SUPPORT AND BUGS

User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other Bioperl
modules. Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list, 
L<bioperl-l@bioperl.org>, rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many
experienced and reponsive experts will be able look at the problem and quickly 
address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem with code and
data examples if at all possible.

If you have found a bug, please report it on the BioPerl bug tracking system
to help us keep track the bugs and their resolution:

=head2 use_weights

 Function: Set whether or not relative abundance should be normalized by taking
           into accout the weights of the different members (e.g. genome length,
           gene copy number). Refer to the C<Bio::Community::Member->weights()>
           method for more details. The default is to use the weights that have
           given to community members.

=head2 get_members_abundance, set_members_abundance

 Function: Get or set the total abundance of members in the community. Setting
           this option implies that you know the total abundance of the members
           in the community, even though you have not have sampled them all. If

 Function: Access the next member in a community (in no specific order). Be
           warned that each time you change the community, this iterator has to
           start again from the beginning! By default, a single iterator is
           created. However, if you need several independent iterators, simply
           provide an arbitrary iterator name.
