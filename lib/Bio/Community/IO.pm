=head1 NAME

Bio::Community::IO - Read and write files that describe communities

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Bio::Community::IO;

  # Read communities from a file, one by one
  my $in = Bio::Community::IO->new(
     -file   => 'otu_table.qiime',
     -format => 'qiime', # format is optional
  );
  my $community1 = $in->next_community(); # a Bio::Community object
  my $community2 = $in->next_community();
  $in->close;

  # Write communities in another file
  my $out = Bio::Community::IO->new(
     -file   => '>new_otu_table.generic',
     -format => 'generic',
  );
  $out->write_community($community);
  $out->close;

  # Re-read communities, but all at once
  $in = Bio::Community::IO->new( -file => 'new_otu_table.generic' );
  my $meta = $in->next_metacommunity(); # a Bio::Community::Meta object
  $in->close;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Bio::Community::IO object implement methods to read and write communities in
formats used by popular programs such as BIOM, GAAS, QIIME, Unifrac, or as
generic tab-separated tables. The format should be automatically detected though
it can be manually specified. This module can also convert community member
abundance between counts, fraction and relative abundance.

When reading communities, the next_member() method is called by next_community(),
which itself is called by next_metacommunity(). Similarly, when writing,
write_member() is called by write_community(), which is called by
write_metacommunity().

=head2 DRIVER IMPLEMENTATION

Bio::Community::IO provides the higher-level organisation to read and write
community files, but it is the modules located in the Bio::Community::IO::Driver::*
namespaces that do the low-level format-specific work.

All drivers are expected to implement specific methods, e.g. for reading:

=over

=item _next_metacommunity_init()

A private hook called at the beginning of next_metacommunity() that returns the
name of the metacommunity (if applicable). It also allows drivers to do an
action before the metacommunity is read.

=item _next_community_init()

A private hook called at the beginning of next_community() that returns the name
of the community. It also allows drivers to do an action before the current
community is read.

=item next_member()

A public method that returns a Bio::Community::Member and its count in the
community being read.

=item _next_community_finish()

A private hook called at the end of next_community(). It allows drivers to do
an action after the current community has been read.

=item _next_metacommunity_finish()

A private hook called at the end of next_metacommunity(). It allows drivers to
do an action after the metacommunity has been read.

=back

Similarly, for a driver to write community information to a file or stream,
it should implement these methods:

=over

=item _write_metacommunity_init()

A private hook called at the beginning of write_metacommunity() and that accepts
a Bio::Community::Meta as argument. It allows drivers to do an action before the
metacommunity is written.

=item _write_community_init()

A private hook called at the beginning of write_community() and that accepts
a Bio::Community as argument. It allows drivers to do an action before the
current community is written.

=item write_member()

A public method that accepts as arguments a Bio::Community::Member and its count
in the community being written, and processes them.

=item _write_community_finish()

A private hook called at the end of write_community() and that accepts a
Bio::Community as argument. It allows drivers to do an action after the
current community has been written.

=back _write_metacommunity_finish()

A private hook called at the end of write_metacommunity() and that accepts a
Bio::Community::Meta as argument. It allows drivers to do an action after the
metacommunity has been written.

=head1 APPENDIX

The rest of the documentation details each of the object
methods. Internal methods are usually preceded with a _

=head2 new

 Function: Create a new Bio::Community::IO object
 Usage   : # Reading a file
           my $in = Bio::Community::IO->new( -file => 'community.txt' );
           # Writing a file
           my $out = Bio::Community::IO->new( -file => '>community.txt',
                                              -format => 'generic'       );
 Args    : -file : Path of a community file. See file() in Bio::Root::IO.
           -format : Format of the file, either 'generic', 'biom', 'gaas',
               'qiime' or 'unifrac'. This is optional when reading a community
               file because the format is automatically detected by the
               Bio::Community::IO::FormatGuesser module. See also format() in
               Bio::Root::IO.
           -weight_files : Arrayref of files (or filehandles) that contain
               weights to assign to members. See weight_files().
           -weight_assign : When using files of weights, define what to do for
               community members that do not have weights. See weight_assign().
           -taxonomy: Given a Bio::DB::Taxonomy object, try to place the community
               members in this taxonomy. See taxonomy().
           -skip_empty_communities: Skip communities with no members. See
               skip_empty_communities()
           See the documentation for _initialize_io() in Bio::Root::IO for other
           accepted constructors like -fh, -string, -input, or -url.
 Returns : A Bio::Community::IO object

           which no weight is found in the provided weight file:
            * $num : Check the member description against each file of weights.
                 If no weight is found in a file, assign the arbitrary weight
                 provided as argument to the member.
            * file_average : Check the member description against each file of
                 weights. If no weight is found in a file, assign the average
                 weight in this file to the member.
            * community_average : Check the member description against each file
                 of weights. If no weight is found in a file, the weight given
                 to the member is the average weight of all the other members in
                 in this community. If none of the community members have
                 weights, the weight assignment method defaults to 'file_average'
                 for this community. Note that because the assigned weight is
                 the average weight in this community, this means that the same
                 members will have different weights in different communities.
                 Note also that the processing of members with no explicit
                 weights can only be done after all other members have been
                 added and is effective only if the community is built using the
                 next_community() method.
            * ancestor : Provided the member have a taxonomic assignment, check
                 the taxonomic lineage of this member against each file of
                 weights. When no weight is found for this taxonomic lineage in
                 a weight file, go up the taxonomic lineage of the member and
                 assign to it the weight of the first ancestor that has a
                 weight in the weights file. Fall back to the 'community_average'
                 method if no taxonomic information is available for this member
                 (for example a member with no BLAST hit), or if none of the
                 ancestors have a specified weight.

=head2 taxonomy

 Usage   : $in->taxonomy();
 Function: When reading communities, try to place the community members on the
           provided taxonomy (provided taxonomic assignments are specified in
           the input. Make sure that you use the same taxonomy as in the
           community file to ensure that members are placed.
           
           As an alternative to using a full-fledged taxonomy, if you provide a
           Bio::DB::Taxonomy::list object containing no taxa, the taxonomy will
           be constructed on the fly from the taxonomic information provided in
           the community file. The advantages are that you build an arbitrary
           taxonomy, and this taxonomy contains only the taxa present in your
           samples, which is fast and memory efficient. A drawback is that
           unfortunately, you can only do this with community file formats that
           report full lineages (e.g. the qiime and generic formats).

           A basic curation is done on the taxonomy strings, so that a GreenGenes
           lineage such as:
              k__Archaea;p__Euryarchaeota;c__Thermoplasmata;o__E2;f__Marine group II;g__;s__
           becomes:
              k__Archaea;p__Euryarchaeota;c__Thermoplasmata;o__E2;f__Marine group II
           Or a Silva lineage such as:
              Bacteria; Cyanobacteria; Chloroplast; uncultured; Other; Other
           becomes:
              Bacteria; Cyanobacteria; Chloroplast; uncultured
