=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role is an IO layer to read and write community files. The only thing it
does is define methods that the role-consuming class must implement. In practice,
this role is should be used by all the IO drivers in the Bio::Community::IO::*
namespace.

Input methods: next_member, next_community, _next_community_init, _next_community_finish
Output methods: write_member, write_community, _write_community_init, _write_community_finish, sort_members
