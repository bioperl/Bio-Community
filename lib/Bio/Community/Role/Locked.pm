=head1 NAME

Bio::Community::Role::Locked - Role for objects that can be locked (made read-only)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package My::Package;

  use Moose;
  with 'Bio::Community::Role::Locked';

  # Use the lock() and unlock() methods as needed
  # ...

  1;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role provides the capability to make objects of the class that consumes this
role read-only. The lock() method can be invoked to make an object read-only,
while unlock() restores the read/write properties of the object. If you try to
call a method to modify an object that is locked or otherwise attempt to change
its hash, you will get an error similar to this:

 Modification of a read-only value attempted at accessor Bio::Community::Member::foo
