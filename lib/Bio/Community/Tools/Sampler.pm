=head1 NAME

Bio::Community::Tools::Sampler - Sample organisms according to their abundance

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Bio::Community::Tools::Sampler;

  # Sample members from a reference community 
  my $sampler = Bio::Community::Tools::Sampler->new( -community => $ref_community );
  my $member1 = $sampler->get_rand_member();
  my $member2 = $sampler->get_rand_member();

  # Or sample 100 members in one step
  my $rand_community = $sampler->get_rand_community( 100 );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Pick individuals at random (without replacement) from a community.

Note that the sampling is done based on relative abundances, and is hence
affected by weights. If you need to sample based on counts instead, simply set
$community->use_weights(0), before using Bio::Community::Tools::Sampler.

=head1 SUPPORT AND BUGS

User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other Bioperl
modules. Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list, 
L<bioperl-l@bioperl.org>, rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many
experienced and reponsive experts will be able look at the problem and quickly 
address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem with code and
data examples if at all possible.

If you have found a bug, please report it on the BioPerl bug tracking system
to help us keep track the bugs and their resolution:
