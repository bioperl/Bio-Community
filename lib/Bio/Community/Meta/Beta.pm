=head1 NAME

Bio::Community::Meta::Beta - Beta diversity or distance separating communities

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Bio::Community::Meta;
  use Bio::Community::Meta::Beta;

  # Beta diversity of two communities
  my $beta = Bio::Community::Meta::Beta->new(
     -metacommunity => Bio::Community::Meta->new(-communities => [$community1, $community2] ),
     -type          => 'euclidean',
  );
  my $value = $beta->get_beta;

  # Beta diversity between all pairs of communities in the given metacommunity
  $beta = Bio::Community::Meta::Beta->new(
     -metacommunity => $meta,
     -type          => 'hellinger',
  );
  my ($average_value, $value_hashref) = $beta->get_all_beta;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Calculate how dissimilar communities are by calculating their beta diversity.
The more different communities are, the larger their beta diversity. Often,
beta diversity metrics are actually a distance measurement.

Several types of beta diversity metrics are available: 1-norm, 2-norm (euclidean),
and infinity-norm, Hellinger distance, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, Jaccard
distance, Sørensen dissimilarity and MaxiPhi index.

Since the relative abundance of community members is not always proportional to
member counts (see weights() in Bio::Community::Member and use_weights() in
Bio::Community), the beta diversity measured here are always based on relative
abundance (as a fractional number between 0 and 1, not as a percentage), even
for beta diversity metrics that are usually based on number of observations
(counts).

User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other Bioperl
modules. Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list, 
L<bioperl-l@bioperl.org>, rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many
experienced and reponsive experts will be able look at the problem and quickly 
address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem with code and
data examples if at all possible.

=head2 new

 Function: Create a new Bio::Community::Meta::Beta object
 Usage   : my $beta = Bio::Community::Meta::Beta->new(
              -metacommunity => $meta,
              -type          => 'euclidean',
           );
 Args    : -metacommunity : See metacommunity(). This is required!
           -type          : See type().
 Returns : a Bio::Community::Meta::Beta object

=head2 metacommunity

 Function: Get or set the communities to process, given as a metacommunity.
 Usage   : my $meta = $beta->metacommunity;
 Args    : A Bio::Community::Meta object
 Returns : A Bio::Community::Meta object

);


=head2 type

 Function: Get or set the beta diversity metric to calculate.
 Usage   : my $type = $beta->type;
 Args    : String for the desired type of beta diversity.

           Qualitative (presence/absence):
            * jaccard: the Jaccard distance (between 0 and 1), i.e. the
                fraction of non-shared species relative to the overall richness
                of the metacommunity.
            * sorensen: the Sørensen dissimilarity (between 0 and 1), i.e. the
                fraction of non-shared species relative to the average richness
                in the metacommunity.
            * shared: percentage of species shared (between 0 and 100), relative
                to the least rich community. Note: this is the opposite
                of a beta diversity measure since the higher the percent of
                species shared, the smaller the beta diversity.

           Quantitative:
            * 1-norm: the 1-norm, i.e. the sum of difference in abundance for
                 all species.
            * 2-norm (euclidean): the 2-norm, or euclidean distance.
            * infinity-norm: the infinity-norm, i.e. the maximum difference in
                 abundance over all species.
            * hellinger: like the euclidean distance, but constrained between 0
                and 1.
            * bray-curtis: the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (or Sørensen quantitative
                index), which varies between 0 and 1.
            * permuted: a beta diversity measure between 0 and 100, representing
                the percentage of the dominant species in the first community
                with a permuted abundance rank in the second community. As a
                special case, when no species are shared (and the percentage
                permuted is meaningless), undef is returned.
            * maxiphi: a beta diversity measure between 0 and 1, based on the 
                percentage of species shared and the percentage of top species
                permuted (that have had a change in abundance rank).

 Returns : String for the desired type of beta diversity

=head2 get_beta

 Function: Calculate the beta diversity between two communities. The input
           metacommunity should contain exactly two communities. The distance is
           calculated based on the relative abundance (in %) of the members (not
           their counts).

 Function: Similar to get_beta(), but return the beta diversity between all pairs

           average beta diversity.
 Usage   : my ($average, $betas) = $beta->get_all_beta;

 Returns : * A number for the average beta diversity
           * A hashref of hashref with the value of all pairwise beta diversities,
