=head1 NAME

Bio::Community::Alpha - Calculate the alpha diversity of a community

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Bio::Community::Alpha;
  
  my $alpha = Bio::Community::Alpha->new( -community => $community,
                                          -type      => 'observed'  );
  my $richness = $alpha->get_alpha;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Bio::Community::Alpha module calculates the alpha diversity within a
community. This module supports different types of alpha diversity metrics:
richness, evenness, dominance and indices. See type() for details.

=head1 SUPPORT AND BUGS

User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other Bioperl
modules. Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list, 
L<bioperl-l@bioperl.org>, rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many
experienced and reponsive experts will be able look at the problem and quickly 
address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem with code and
data examples if at all possible.

If you have found a bug, please report it on the BioPerl bug tracking system
to help us keep track the bugs and their resolution:

=head2 type

 Function: Get or set the type of alpha diversity metric to measure.
 Usage   : my $type = $alpha->type;
 Args    : String for the desired type of alpha diversity ('observed' by default).

           Richness (or estimated number of species):
            * observed :  C<S>
            * menhinick:  C<S/sqrt(n)>, where C<n> is the total counts (observations).
            * margalef : C<(S-1)/ln(n)>
            * chao1    : Bias-corrected chao1 richness, C<S+n1*(n1-1)/(2*(n2+1))>
                         where C<n1> and C<n2> are the number of singletons and
                         doubletons, respectively. Particularly useful for data
                         skewed toward the low-abundance species, e.g. microbial.
                         Based on counts, not relative abundance.
            * ace      : Abundance-based Coverage Estimator (ACE). Based on
                         counts, not relative abundance.

           Evenness (or equitability):
            * buzas      : Buzas & Gibson's (or Sheldon's) evenness, C<e^H/S>.
                           Ranges from 0 to 1.
            * heip       : Heip's evenness, C<(e^H-1)/(S-1)>. Ranges from 0 to 1.
            * shannon_e  : Shannon's evenness, or the Shannon-Wiener index
                           divided by the maximum diversity possible in the
                           community. Ranges from 0 to 1.
            * simpson_e  : Simpson's evenness, or the Simpson's Index of Diversity
                           divided by the maximum diversity possible in the
                           community. Ranges from 0 to 1.
            * brillouin_e: Brillouin's evenness, or the Brillouin's index divided
                           by the maximum diversity possible in the community.
                           Ranges from 0 to 1.
            * hill_e     : Hill's C<E_2,1> evenness, i.e. Simpson's Reciprocal
                           index divided by C<e^H>.
            * mcintosh_e : McIntosh's evenness.
            * camargo    : Camargo's eveness. Ranges from 0 to 1.

           Indices (accounting for species abundance):
            * shannon  : Shannon-Wiener index C<H>. Emphasizes richness and ranges
                         from 0 to infinity.
            * simpson  : Simpson's Index of Diversity C<1-D> (or Gini-Simpson
                         index), where C<D> is Simpson's dominance index. C<1-D>
                         is the probability that two individuals taken randomly
                         are not from the same species. Emphasizes evenness and
                         anges from 0 to 1.
            * simpson_r: Simpson's Reciprocal Index C<1/D>. Ranges from 1 to
                         infinity.
            * brillouin: Brillouin's index, appropriate for small, completely
                         censused communities. Based on counts, not relative
                         abundance.
            * hill     : Hill's C<N_inf> index, the inverse of the Berger-Parker
                         dominance. Ranges from 1 to infinity.
            * mcintosh : McIntosh's index. Based on counts, not relative abundance.

           Dominance (B<not> diversity metrics since the higher their value, the
           lower the diversity):
            * simpson_d: Simpson's Dominance Index C<D>. Ranges from 0 to 1.
            * berger   : Berger-Parker dominance, i.e. the proportion of the most
                         abundant species. Ranges from 0 to 1.

 Returns : String for the desired type of alpha diversity.
