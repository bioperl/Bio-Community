=head1 NAME

Bio::Community::IO::Driver::generic - Driver to read and write files in a generic tab-delimited site-by-species table format

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   my $in = Bio::Community::IO->new( -file => 'gaas_communities.txt', -format => 'generic' );

   # See Bio::Community::IO for more information

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Bio::Community::IO::Driver::generic driver reads and writes files in a generic
format. Multiple communities can be written in a file to generate a site-by-
species table (OTU table), in which the entries are tab-delimited. Example:

  Species	site A	site B
  species 1	321	94
  species 2	0	58
  species 3	47	26

For each Bio::Community::Member $member generated from a generic site-by-species
file, $member->desc() contains the content of the species field. Since the
generic format does not specify a member ID, one is automatically generated
and can be retrieved using $member->id().

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

See L<Bio::Community::IO>.

=head1 SUPPORT AND BUGS

User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other Bioperl
modules. Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list, 
L<bioperl-l@bioperl.org>, rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many
experienced and reponsive experts will be able look at the problem and quickly 
address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem with code and
data examples if at all possible.

If you have found a bug, please report it on the BioPerl bug tracking system
to help us keep track the bugs and their resolution:
