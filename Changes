  - New Accumulator module for collector and rarefaction curves
  - Option names pluralized to -alpha_types and -beta_types in bc_measure_alpha
    and bc_measure_beta for clarity

0.1.6 2014-04-29
  - New script, bc_manage_members, to rename and remove given community members
  - Added new richness estimators to Bio::Community::Gamma: Chao-2 (suggested by
    Renato Santos), ICE and jackknife (first & second-order)
  - Added first and second-order jackknife estimators to Bio::Community::Alpha
  - ACE estimator of richness now falls back to Chao-1 in special case (as
    advised by Anne Chao and implemented in EstimateS)

  - Bio::Community::next_member is faster and now returns identical objects

    a valid taxonomic ID

  - Changes to script bc_measure_distance:
    * Renamed to bc_measure_beta
    * Can now be passed a list of metrics to compute
  - New script to calculate alpha diversity, bc_measure_alpha
  - Alpha diversity metrics in Bio::Community::Alpha more robust to special cases
  - Bio::Community::Gamma can now use the same metrics as Bio::Community::Alpha

  - More accurate arithmetic comparisons in Bio::Community::Tools::Summarizer
